# OpenWebUI, versions and license

Aarhus AI is built on OpenWebUI. We have forked the project, but continuously updates the OpenWebUI version, keeping
up with releases from core.
This is done to make sure we get new and fancy nice features and to keep the product secure and safe to use.
When a new version of OpenWebUI is released we start our work testing the new release, sometimes this takes a while,
as tests fails and new patches needs to be created, and bugs fixed.
